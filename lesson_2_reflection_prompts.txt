To create a git repository you use the command

git init

this creates an initial repository with no files added you can 
check the status of a git repository using the command

git status

then in the empty git you can add files by

git add "FILE NAME"

once the files have been added they are put into a staging area.  You can then check these out again using the 

git status

This should show any files you have added to the stagign area.  To actually put the command

git commit

this will then commit the files into the staging area and the staging area and commiting the changes you will have to enter a comment into the working directory and the comment

When dealing with branching you can you the command

git branch

this will tell you the name of the branch you are currently on and also the names of the other branches.  You can then you the command

git branch NAME_OF_BRANCH

to create a new branch.  You can then use the command 

git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH

to checkout another branch or the branch you have just created.

any changes you commit will be associated with this branch

Then if you would like to merge the branches you can use the command

git merge NAME_OF_BRANCH_1 NAME_OF_BRANCH_2
